    "**Inter-group and intra-group differences:** As the sample size grows, estimates become increasingly precise, but it is important to remember that a highly precise estimate for the mean does not imply that individuals within a population do not vary from each other.  To put the differences shown above in context, below we show the underlying summaries on which the plot above was based.  Note that the standard deviation of BMI within both females and males ranges from around 5 to around 8 depending on the age band.  This means, for example, that two randomly-selected males will tend to have BMI values that differ by around 6 units.  This is a far greater difference than the mean difference of up to around 1.5 BMI units between females and males.  Thus, while there is a tendency for females to have slightly higher BMI than males, the heterogeneity within genders is substantially greater than the difference of means between genders."

    "Confidence intervals reflect the precision of an estimate, which is largely driven by the amount of data used to construct the estimate.  We can explore the relationship between precision and sample size by subampling data from NHANES and calculating confidence intervals for the subsamples.  Below we calculate confidence intervals based on subsamples of size 100, 200, 400, and 800.\n",

In the simulation below, we calculate the average width of the confidence intervals constructed for each sample size.  We see that the confidence interval steadily becomes shorter as the sample size grows.  For most settings, the confidence interval will become around half as wide when the sample size is increased by a factor of 4.  Below we see this scaling when the sample size increases from 100 to 400, and when it increases from 200 to 800, both of which are increases by a factor of 4."
