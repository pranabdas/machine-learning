There are certain type of problems we face in everyday life that cannot be
solved by definitive algorithm, e.g., object recognition, predicting financial
markets etc. In such cases, we collect a set of input and output samples (called
training set); and based on the trends on those data, we try to predict future
outcomes.

We will see there are three broad category of machine learning problems: (1)
supervised, (2) unsupervised learning, and (3) reinforcement learning. As the
names suggest in the first case, we have data available to train our model.

(1) Supervised machine learning problems has two categories (a) classification
and (b) regression. In case of classification, we have discrete targets/labels (
e.g., whether an email is real or spam, whether the image is of a cat or dog),
while in case of regression, we need to predict a quantitative value (e.g.,
predicting second hand car price based on a set of features like brand, color,
mileage driven, engine size etc.). The supervised regression is more like
standard fitting program.

(2) On the other hand, in case of unsupervised learning problem, we do not have
associated data labels. Like segmenting customers for a supermarket or bank,
clustering similar music or movies etc.

(3) Finally, reinforcement learning is based on the interaction, it finds the
optimal solution for a dataset in order to maximize a reward.

### The Machine Learning Process
1. Data collection and preparation
2. Feature selection
3. Algorithm selection
4. Parameter and Model selection
5. Training
6. Evaluation

:::note Question?

Today data science is widely utilized by technology companies to deliver
advertisement recommendations, other recommendation systems like news feed,
songs, videos, shopping; supply and demand analysis, speech recognition/ natural
language processing, lifestyle improvements including medical applications,
recognize pattern to detect frauds etc. Most of these applications requires
extremely large and complex datasets. Are there applications where small
datasets from our day to day life can be useful in a practical way?
